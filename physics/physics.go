// Physics is a real-time simulation of real-world physics. Physics applies
// simulated forces to virtual 3D objects known as bodies. Physics updates
// bodies locations and directions based on forces and collisions with
// other bodies.
//
// Bodies are created using NewBody(shape). For example:
//    box    := NewBody(NewBox(hx, hy, hz))
//    sphere := NewBody(NewSphere(radius))
//
// Creating and storing bodies is the responsibility of the calling application.
// Bodies are moved with frequent and regular calls to Physics.Step().
// Regulating the calls to Step() is also the responsibility of the calling
// application. Once Step() has completed, the bodies updated location and
// direction are available in Body.World().
//
// Package physics is provided as part of the vu (virtual universe) 3D engine.
