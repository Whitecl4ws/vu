// FUTURE : lots can be done here, but needs to be balanced with cluttering
//          up the engine code. Variations in timing are expected to be mostly
//          influenced by device capability, ie: mobile devices are less capable
//          than consoles or desktops.
//      o Rendering times are not currently captured from the machine goroutine.
//      o Loading times are not currently captured from the loader goroutine.

// Timing is used to collect main processing loop numbers while the

// values over a number of updates.

// Timing gives a rough idea. Expect things to go slower the more
// models, draw calls, and the greater number of verticies.
//
// FPS = Renders/Elapsed. This is how many render requests were sent.
// Actual number of renders is likely at the monitor refresh rate
// which is 60/sec for most flat screen monitors.
