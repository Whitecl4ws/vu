// Package ai provides support for application unit behaviour.
// This is an experimental package that currently provides a behaviour
// tree implementation.
//
// Package ai is provided as part of the vu (virtual universe) 3D engine.
package ai

// Design Notes:
// Other AI support may be provided if:
//    • It is generic, ie. most of AI seems to be application
//      specific so it is unclear how much an engine can help.
//    • It is usefull, ie. simple AI's can be done with if-else statements,
//      so no engine help is necessary.
// Possible areas to investigate are:
//    • Helping smooth unit movement (assuming unit has a path from
//      vu/grid path or flow).
